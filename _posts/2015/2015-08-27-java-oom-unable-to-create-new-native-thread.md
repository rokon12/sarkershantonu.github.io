In this post I will provide how to reproduce Java OutOfMemoryError :Unable to create new native thread . We will see how to recreate and what are the impact in monitoring tools.

This is a continuing article of [out of memory error/explanation](https://sarkershantonu.github.io/2015/08/21/java-oom-why/).  

I am using **Oracle JVM 1.6 x64** & **Oracle JVM 1.8 x64** on windows 7 x64/8gb ram/ 2.5Ghz Core i5 laptop. 

## Tools : 
### IDE : 
- Eclipse
### Profiling/Monitoring tool :
1. Visual VM
2. Jconsole (optional)
3. Yourkit (optional)

I am using some JVM flags to get detail GC information and monitoring via JMX. 

Now, for the nature of the error, it is easily untestable , due to PCâ€™s limitations, JVM is unable to create new thread. Again, to know about the error, you can visit [**the original post**](https://sarkershantonu.github.io/2015/08/21/java-oom-why/).

### Scenario :
I will write a function which will actually create many threads, start them, make them a demon thread(so that they are kept running) and store all thread in a collection. 

This will make the number of thread grows and we can get the error.

### [Code](https://github.com/sarkershantonu/jvm-novice-to-advance/blob/master/java-out-of-memory/src/main/java/org/automation/oom/threading/ThreadOOM.java) :

```
public class ThreadOOM {
    public static void createOOMbyThread(){
        List<Thread> allThreads = new ArrayList<Thread>();
        try{
        while(true)    
        {
            long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();//to know timing is optional            
            Thread aThread = new Thread(new Runnable(){// Anonymous runnable class
                  @Override
                  public void run() {
                      //System.out.println("Thread is running");
                    try {
                      while (!Thread.interrupted())//this will sleep the thread untill it is stopped.  
                      {                          
                        Thread.sleep(1);
                      }} catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}}});
                aThread.setDaemon(true);
                aThread.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
                allThreads.add(aThread);
                aThread.start();    
            long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();//to know timing is optional
            Thread.sleep(1);//if you need more wait, you can avoid to have quick impact
            System.err.println("Total Thread = "+allThreads.size()+" Required time(ms) = "+(endTime-startTime));            
        }
        }catch(Throwable e){
            System.err.println("\nError at "+ allThreads.size()+" threads"); 
            e.printStackTrace();
        }    
}}
```

And from main method , just call ```ThreadOOM.createOOMbyThread();```

## Error analysis in console  : 
- Java 6 : Error happened in 3007 thread.

![j6-error](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6.png)

BTW, this number is not same always, it is based on CPU/Memory load. When I attached yourkit agent , it was less in numbers.

- Java 8 : Amazingly, Java 8 went up to 200906 thread. For less delay, I commented thread delay (2nd one) so that it moves faster. My PC become very slow resource usages were very very high. It seems Java 8 have separate mechanism to provide very high performance. 

![j8-error](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j8.png)

## Java 6 Monitoring in Visual VM : 
- I attached visual VM next time, and got error 3015 threads. So, the console error. 

![j6-jvisualvm-error](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-jvisualvm.png)

- As, JVM run user application by its own demon threads, so, in visual VM the count is little extra to 3030 (our created demon threads + predefined demon threads)

![j6-jvisualvm-threads](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-jvisualvm-thread-status.png)

- And, if we look at GC activity, we can see how much CPU it was  taking

![j6-jvisualvm-gc](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-jvisualvm-gc-status.png)

You may noticed, 727% , actually JVM consider single thread as 100% CPU usages. And if you have multiple core or thread, it will multiply. 

In case of tweak/boost/overclock CPU it will increase the %. As my CPU was Core i5 2.5Ghz to boostable upto 3.1Ghz and when JVM starts it used to be running below 2Ghz. So, overall, it multiply single CPU thread performance and number of thread.

- And the heap usages 

![j6-jvisualvm-heap](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-jvisualvm-heap.png)

- PermGen usages

![j6-jvisualvm-permgen](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-jvisualvm-permgen.png)


### Java 6 Monitoring in Yourkit: 
- When I attached your kit the thread OOM happened in 2228 threads and heap was this.

![j6-yourkit-error](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-yourkit.png)

- As, yourkit has some initial delay to attach with application, if we see from your kit, we may see less number of thread. In  my case it was 2185.

![j6-yourkit-thread](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-yourkit-thread-status.png)

- And this was Heap usages 

![j6-yourkit-heap](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j6-with-yourkit-heap.png)

## Java 8 Monitoring : 

#### Visual VM : 
- When I used visual VM, OOM occurred after 189772 threads but, it also cased 
1. stackoverflow error
2. VisualVM crashed

![j8-jvisualvm-error](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j8-with-jvisualvm.png)

So, in that I should say, it was possible to create OOM with profiler but not possible properly to diagnosis. Similar story happened for Your kit also.

These are exceptions from log (in case you are interested), **Internal exceptions** (10 events):

```

#### Yourkit : 

I was trying to add yourkit to profiler , then I got error  after 225167 threads. I found this in my console. 

![j8-yourkit-error](/images/java/jvm/oom/thread-error-j8-with-yourkit.png)

![j8-jvm-crashed](/images/java/jvm/oom/jvm-crash.png)

From JVM logs, I found this error **EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION**. 

It is easily understandable this error occurred due yourkit was trying to access JVM which was running with high PC resource and could not load JMX thread to connect with your kit. 

So these are exceptions (last 10)  from error log. (in case you are interested to know. **Internal exceptions** (10 events):
