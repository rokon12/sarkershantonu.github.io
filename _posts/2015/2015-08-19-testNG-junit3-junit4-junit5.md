In this article we are going to see learn about TestNG, JUnit 3 & JUnit 4 by Comparison. All of them are Java test runners but, while we are writing tests , what are annotations and basic work differences among Junit3-Junit-TestNG will be described here. It is very helpful for quick review on unit tests.

As we know, all of them are initially Unit test framework and later on they come up with intelligent reporting, more advance testing concepts like theory & assumption. But all of them are commonly use different ways of testing. I wont be talking about in detail differences but, we will talk about more or less overall functionality with comparison.
