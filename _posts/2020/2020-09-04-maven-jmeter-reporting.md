[draft]
In this article we are going to see how we can get good reports in jmeter after tests. This is continuation post of [this original article](https://sarkershantonu.github.io/2020/08/28/maven-jmeter/).

### Jmeter Reports
In Jmeter, we can have different type of test results. 
1. CSV test results (default selection by plugins)
2. JTL logs 
3. [HTML Results](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/generating-dashboard.html) (modern report)
4. Jmeter Listener Graphs : Images/reports created by Jmeter Listeners
