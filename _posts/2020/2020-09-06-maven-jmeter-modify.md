In this article we are going to see how we can customize jmeter when executing with maven plugin. This is continuation post of [this original article](https://sarkershantonu.github.io/2020/08/28/maven-jmeter/).

In the last article, we know about how we can configure Jmeter plugins. Now, when testing in jmeter, if we need any 3rd party JAR/Lib, how we can do that. We will see that now. 

And, if we use very minimum element in Jmeter, we may not need jmeter complete version to run, we can run minimum jmeter. That means, less download time, less java memory usages, faster loading. We will see this here.
