In this article we are going to see how to work **idlj**commands.

What is idl?
IDL means interface definition Language.

# What is idlj?
**idlj** builds IDL file to JAVA following [specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/idl/mapping/jidlMapping.html). 

Previously it was named as idltojava. idlj is a compiler that reads an OMG(Object Management Group) IDLfile and translates / maps to a Java interface. 

It creates stub, skeleton, helper, holder and other necessary files. The specified pdf formatted OMG  file defines the interface file(.java).

# Syntax

    idlj [options] [idl-file]
    

jdlj Options : 
-d [symbol] : Is same as #define symbol in a idl file. 
-emitAll : Emit all types along with files found in #include 
-f[side] : Defines bindings to emit. A side can be client, server, serverTIE, all, or allTIE. fserverTIE and -fallTIE cause delegate to be emitted.(-fclient is not specified)
-i [include-path] : To add another directory for scanning with default one. 
-keep : To set not to overwrite an existed file.
-noWarn : Set No warning messages.
-oldImplBase : Generates skeletons compatible with pre-1.4 JDK ORBs.(backward-compatibility to  ImplBase Inheritance Model classes)
-pkgPrefix [type] [prefix] : Generates Java package name with prefix for all files generated for that type(type is the simple name of either a top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside of any module)
-pkgTranslate [type] [package] : Replaces type module in the identifier with package for all generated Java package files
Note -pkgPrefix changes are made first. If more than one translation matches an identifier, the longest match is chosen.
-td [dir] : To set dir as output directory 
-verbose : Verbose mode(Same as -nowarn)
-skeletonName [xxx%yyy] : Naming pattern for skeleton. The defaults are: %POA for the POA base class (-fserver /-fall), _%ImplBase for the oldImplBase class (-oldImplBase and -fserver /-fall)

-tieName [xxx%yyy] : Naming pattern for tie .The defaults are: %POATie for the POA tie base class (-fserverTie /-fallTie), %_Tie for the oldImplBase tie class (-oldImplBase and -fserverTie /-fallTie)

Notes:
-Escaped identifiers in the global scope may not have the same spelling as IDL primitive types, Object, or ValueBase as the symbol table is pre-loaded with these identifiers
-The fixed IDL type is not supported.
-No import for global identifiers. When we invoke on an unexported local impl,we will get exception, (due to a NullPointerException in the ServerDelegate DSI code)

Uses: When we are using old OMG IDL code to rewriting new java code. Spatially used while converting old codes/definitions. Some time it is used to followup old interface. 

Thanks...:)
